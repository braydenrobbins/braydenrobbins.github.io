        Overview
        <h2>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>
        In a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world. This organization, known as Overwatch, ended the crisis and helped maintain peace for a generation, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. After many years, Overwatch's influence waned and it was eventually disbanded. Now in the wake of its dismantling, conflict is rising once again. Overwatch may be gone... but the world still needs heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Choose A Hero:</b> Overwatch features a wide array of unique Heroes, ranging from a time-jumping adventurer, to an armored, rocket-hammer-wielding warrior, to a transcendent robot monk. Every hero plays differently, and mastering their Abilities is the key to unlocking their potential. No two heroes are the same.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Play Your Role:</b> Whether you're engaging in combat on the front line, providing defensive cover with your energy shield, or supporting your allies by amplifying their damage, every hero's abilities are designed to be effective as part of a team. Learning to utilize your Abilities in concert with your teammates' is the key to victory.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Team Based Objectives:</b> Teams of heroes do battle across the planet. From protecting the secrets of the mysterious Temple of Anubis, to safely escorting an EMP device through King's Row, the world is your battlefield.

            <header>
                <h2>
                Ana
                <h2>
            </header>
 
            <section>
                <p>Ana's versatile arsenal allows her to affect heroes all over the battlefield. Her Biotic Rifle rounds and Biotic Grenades heal allies and damage or impair enemies; her sidearm tranquilizes key targets, and Nano Boost gives one of her comrades a considerable increase in power.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy:</b> Ana is a mid to long-range Support sniper, capable of healing at any range while also maintaining a fair level of damage output. Her Biotic Grenade lets her amplify healing effects from not only her own healing darts but also from other Supports and environmental healing, such as Payloads and Health packs. She has a sidearm which will fire a Sleep Dart, which can render the enemy who's hit with it temporary useless unless someone wakes them up. Nano Boost is a supportive ultimate that is used to provide strong buffs to an ally, allowing them to deal more damage while taking less damage from the enemy. She can also be an anti-healer as her Biotic Grenade will prevent enemies hit by the blast from getting healed in any way, making her an outstanding support. Ana lacks all source of mobility and only has her sidearm to protect herself, making it easy for her to be outflanked by the flankers as well as other mobile heroes.</p>

                Brigitte
                <h2>
            </header>
 
            <section>
                <p>Brigitte specializes in armor. She can throw Repair Packs to heal teammates, or automatically heal nearby allies when she damages foes with her Flail. Her Flail is capable of a wide swing to strike multiple targets, or a Whip Shot that stuns [sic] an enemy at range. When entering the fray, Barrier Shield provides personal defense while she attacks enemies with Shield Bash. Brigitte‚Äôs ultimate ability, Rally, gives her a substantial short-term boost of speed and provides long-lasting armor to all her nearby allies.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy:</b> Brigitte is a versatile support hero who specializes in providing armor to allies. Unlike other supports, she is a front-line unit who provides protection similar to tanks rather than staying on the backline. The large healing aura generated by Inspire makes her most useful when her team stays together. Despite her strength in close combat, she has little to no means of harming the enemy at range. If hacked, she has almost no means of helping her team at all.</p>

                <p>On the battlefield, L√∫cio‚Äôs cutting-edge Sonic Amplifier buffets enemies with projectiles and knocks foes back with blasts of sound. His songs can both heal his team or boost their movement speed, and he can switch between tracks on the fly.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy: L√∫cio is a versatile Support who requires good situational awareness to master. His aura allow him to contribute damage in fights while passively buffing his allies, and he can protect against enemy ultimates and enable his team to make aggressive pushes using his Sound Barrier. He can escape dangerous situations using his Amped Up speed aura and his Soundwave's knockback effect, giving him a relatively high survivability for a support hero. While his damage output is lower than many other Supports and he doesn't have high single-target healing like Ana or Mercy, his multiple-target healing and speed buffs make him a valuable member of any team.</b></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Mercy‚Äôs Valkyrie Suit helps keep her close to teammates like a guardian angel; healing, resurrecting or strengthening them with the beams emanating from her Caduceus Staff.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy:Mercy is the most healing-oriented of the Support characters, capable of rapidly bringing her teammate back up to full Health and even using Resurrect to bring them back from the dead. Her ultimate enhances all of her abilities, making it a potential game-changer during dire situations. When not healing, she is able to boost a single ally's damage, allowing them to blast apart foes and tear through barriers. She is easily the most team-dependent of the Supports, as her personal damage is weak, and the powerful effect of her Resurrect makes her a prime target for the enemy team, forcing her to rely on her team for protection.</b></p>
            </section>

            <img src="Characters/Moira/Moira.png"/>
            <header>
                <h2>
                     Moira
                <h2>
            </header>
 
            <section>
                <p>Moira‚Äôs biotic abilities enable her to contribute healing or damage in any crisis. While Biotic Grasp gives Moira short-range options, her Biotic Orbs contribute longer-range, hands-off damage and healing; she can also Fade to escape groups or remain close to allies in need of support. Once she‚Äôs charged Coalescence, Moira can save multiple allies from elimination at once or finish off weakened enemies.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy:</b>Moira is a support hero that can easily reposition amongst her allies with her immense mobility. Though Biotic Grasp's healing isn't a lock-on, nor does it instantly reach the target, it can heal multiple allies simultaneously, granting her higher average healing per second when compared to other supports. However, this powerful healing is limited by a resource meter similar to D.Va's Defense Matrix; this meter refills very slowly over time, but Biotic Grasp's alternate fire refills it much faster, along with healing Moira herself. Fade provides her a very strong movement tool and invulnerability that makes her very hard to lock down. Biotic Orb can allow Moira to apply both damage and healing at the same time, and is very powerful in enclosed spaces where it will not simply fly past it's targets. Coalescence can both heal allies and damage enemies, but perhaps most importantly it can pierce barriers, preventing enemy tanks from blocking your ultimate with various shields. Her alternate fire gives her amazing sustain, particularly in 1v1 fights, and her Fade gives her excellent escapes, greatly aiding her survivability against enemy flankers, though she remains weak to large burst damage such as enemy Snipers or Junkrat. Her kit, though very strong, lacks the utility other healers provide, making her focused though not particularly versatile.</p>

                    Zenyatta
                <h2>
            </header>
 
            <section>
                <p>Zenyatta calls upon orbs of harmony and discord to heal his teammates and weaken his opponents, all while pursuing a transcendent state of immunity to damage.</p>
                <p><b>Strategy:</b> Zenyatta is a potent offense-focused Support. He stands out from the other supports due to his incredible killing power: his Orb of Destruction and Orb of Discord can let him shred through even the sturdiest of Tanks with well aimed shots. While not as powerful a healer as Mercy, his Orb of Harmony and Transcendence abilities are more than enough to let him keep a team alive when used smartly. All of this power is counterbalanced by a severe lack of mobility. Unless Zenyatta is using his ultimate, he moves at a relatively slow pace, and has no abilities to speed him up. This makes him vulnerable to agile flankers or large amounts of incoming fire.</p>
